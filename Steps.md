## **Step 1:** _Defining the question (the object)_

This is also called, defining the objective.
suppose a company is losing customers, our goal would be find the answer to the
question which factors are leading to the loss of the customers.

This is the most important step in the data analysis process.

## **Step 2:** _Collecting the data._

Given the raw data, we can either derive some data parameters based on the requirement
to answer to the question found in (**Step 1:**)

Here, we'll need to look into already available data source and decide if we need
any more derived parameters from it.

## **Step 3:** _Cleaning the data._

Here we need to look for missing / irrelevant data and also look for outliers and cleaning the irrelevant parts.
This will take most of the time, and requires a good focus. We can use some open-source tools or
method to clean the data.

## **Step 4:** _Analyzing the data._

In this step we need to analyze the data. And need to do predictive analysis (based on our current type of data).
In this step, we'll generate to be interpreted outcomes from raw data.

## **Step 5:** _Sharing the results._

At this stage, we need to create report from the results of the analysis we did in the last step.
We need to create visualizations and write human readable reports for expressing our understanding to non-tech people.
