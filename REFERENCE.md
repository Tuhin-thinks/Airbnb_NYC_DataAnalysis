## Q. What is airbnb and how does it work?

    Airbnb is a website where people can rent out their properties to other people. It is a peer-to-peer marketplace where people can list their properties and other people can book them. Airbnb takes a cut of the transaction from both the host and the guest. Airbnb is a two-sided marketplace where the host and the guest are the two sides.

## Q. How does airbnb data looks like? What are the parameters?

> We will be using the [**"New York City Airbnb Open Data"** from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data).
> \
> It contains **user-review data** from `28-Mar-2011` to `08-Jul-2019`.

## Q. What is the inspiration for the analysis?

1. We can learn about prices based on particular location.
2. We can learn about the popularity of a particular location.
3. We can gain information about the availability of a particular location.
4. We can generate insights about factors leading to price/review of specific rooms.
5. There is a chance to find out, how catchy titles affect the bookings of a particular room. _(This is a bonus point, we can try to explore this if we have time.)_
